Mostly you will have to deal with binary classifications, multiclass classifications, and multilabel classifications. Binary classification implies a problem where a label is binary: yes or no, cat or dog, give a loan or request additional verification. Multiclass classification solves a problem with many classes, but each sample can only be in one class. For example, "apples, pears or plums". Multilabel classification assigns several labels at once, this task is very popular in text classification: drama, history, and comedy can be genres of one single book.

A quick note on the difference between classification and clustering tasks. Classification implies that we already know the labels for some of the data. Clustering is a search for structure within the data without knowing the exact answer.
